## Final Class
When a class is declared with final keyword, it is called a final class. A final class cannot be extended(inherited).  <br>
There are two uses of a final class: <br>
<li>One is definitely to prevent inheritance, as final classes cannot be extended. For example, all Wrapper Classes like Integer, Float, etc. are final classes. We can not extend them.</li>
<li>The other use of final with classes is to create an immutable class like the predefined String class. One can not make a class immutable without making it final.</li>

## Observer Pattern
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state. The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.<br>
Usage examples: The Observer pattern is pretty common in Java code, especially in the GUI components. It provides a way to react to events happening in other objects without coupling to their classes. <br>

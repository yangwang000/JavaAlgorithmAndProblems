# Problem Solving

Although I had been working as an SDET for 6 years, I am still new to LeetCode. Until today(Nov 20, 2021), I have solved 47/2081 problems, haha!

I just started reading the book [Problem-Solving Through Problems](https://math.la.asu.edu/~ifulman/spring13/mat194/problem-solving.pdf) recently and found some problem-solving skills in this book really helpful when I`m trying to solve some of the leetcode problems!
